                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My journey in the world of technology began in 2014 when I dove into creating webspell and DHCP webpages, as well as designing templates. This early experience sparked my passion for web development and set the stage for my future career.

                    In 2015, I embarked on my university adventure, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Throughout my academic journey, I found my calling in Software Engineering, which became my area of specialization. After seven years of rigorous study and hands-on projects, I proudly completed my degree in 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since graduating, I've been putting my skills and knowledge to work at the University of Siegen. Here, I continue to grow as a professional, tackling new challenges and contributing to exciting projects in the academic world.

                <p>
                    My background in web development, combined with my formal education in Software Engineering, allows me to approach problems with both creativity and technical expertise. I'm passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly solutions and am always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies in this ever-evolving field.
